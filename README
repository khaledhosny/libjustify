LibJustify is a library for high quality justification derived from LibHnj. It
is dual licensed under both LGPL and MPL to encourage widespread use.

The code is currently fairly rough. In particular, psset has many
fixed-size buffers and is simply not suitable for production. Further
speedups are also possible, although the code isn't exactly slow now.
