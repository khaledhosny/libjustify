	* configure.in: Bumped the version number to 0.1.1.

1999-02-11  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* hsjust.c (hnj_hs_just): Fixed it up a bit so that the breaks are
	guaranteed to have x0s in strictly increasing order.  If any out of
	order breaks are found, the earlier one has its penalty increased
	sharply.

1999-02-05  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* .cvsignore: Added libhnj-config and libhnj.spec.

	* libhnj.m4, libhnj-config.in: Added these to CVS.  They allow
 	applications to find libhnj, no matter where it gets installed.

	* Makefile.am: Added libhnj.m4, libhnj-config, and libhnj.spec.

	* configure.in: Added creation of libhnj-config and libhnj.spec.
	Changed it so that the version number is computed from major,
	minor, and micro version numbers.

	* libhnj.spec.in: Added this to CVS.  The version number gets
 	automatically generated.

	* Makefile.am: Added libhnj.spec.

1999-02-01  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* configure.in: Fixed the name of the module in configure.in.
	Bumped version number to 0.1.0.

	* hqjust.c (hnj_hq_just): Changed the max_neg_space mechanism to
	use a fraction of total_space, rather than per-space amount. Fixed
	some subtle bugs in the max_neg_space handling.

	* hsjust.c (hnj_hs_just): Changed the max_neg_space mechanism to
	be a fraction of total_space, rather than a per-space amount.
	Also fixed the space in the case where there's a tab in the middle
	of the line.

	* psset.c: use a more reasonable value for max_neg_space.

1999-01-03  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* hsjust.c (hnj_hs_just): Added code to make sure that tabs at the
	beginning of the line work.

1999-01-03  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* just.h, hsjust.c (hnj_hs_just): Added tabbing to the algorithm
	in hsjust.c.  Tabs should be 0 width breaks (x0 = x1) with flags =
	HNJ_JUST_FLAG_ISTAB.  params.tab_width should also be set unless
	you want 1 unit tabs.
